# ep__previewtable

## What is ep_previewtable?
An Etherpad Plugin to apply the ep_previewtable functionality in a pad. (It can show the table on Etherpad while you paste the HTML code of table)
Currently supports:
*Paste the <br/><table>.......</table><br/> that can show the HTML table

## ep_previewtable Usage
Experimental.  As a special attribute on Etherpad, some weirdness may be experienced by using ep_previewtable.

## ep_previewtable History
I decided to copy/paste the ep_previewimages code over ep__previewtable to create that plugin.
And I will change a little bit to let it from images to table.
